*Children component:

{
	path:'', component: ContactManagerComponent, 
		children: [
			{path:'main', component: MainContentComponent}
		]
}
For both the path 'localhost/4200' and 'localhost/4200/main' "ContactManagerComponent" component will be loaded
because it is set as parent component.
But the "MainContentComponent" component will only be loaded for this path 'localhost/4200/main'

*Component Interaction
The local variable approach is simple and easy. 
But it is limited because the parent-child wiring must be done entirely within the parent template.
The parent component itself has no access to the child.

*Route
One is ActivatedRoute which we have used to subscribe the params(in main-content.component.ts)
Another is Router which we have used to navigate (in sidenav.component.ts)
