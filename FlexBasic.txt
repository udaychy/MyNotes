Lets take an example of ul li where ul is set to be an flexbox container
and all the li are the child items of the flex container

-The main container should be 'display:flex'

*child property:
-'flex-grow: 1' will equally divide the width of the li elements across the screen 
even if we have set the width of li.
 we can change the proportion of child li by assigning different values to 'flex-grow' to each li item
-'order: odrerNumber'



*parent property
flex-direction: row/row-reverse/column/column-reverse

'flex-wrap:wrap' : if we set the width of the child items then once the size of 
screen reduces to less than the combined width of all child items then items will be
wraped to next line.
 
'justify-content': (horizontal spacing/placement)
 if the flex-grow property is not set then the width of the items will be its width value('width' property).
In that case we can use the 'justify-content' property

justify-content: flex-start/flex-end/center/space-between/space-around

'align-items': same as justify-content but vertical spacing/placement
 If we set the height of the parent container then this property will 
 help for the vertical alignment
 
align-items: flex-start/flex-end/center/stretch/baseline



*child property
 align-self : just to override the align-items value for specific child
