Angular JIT and AOT
JIT: Angular compiler code is loaded into the browser (which is roughly half the size of angular itself) 
	compiles your app in the browser at runtime, 
	
	*** compiles means components and html templates is converted to executable JavaScript(NOT machine code)

AOH: Compiles the app into JS during build time and browser donot need to download angular compiler anymore.
